# RvsPython

In this project, we conducted an analysis of the energy consumption associated with different machine learning algorithms using the standard libraries of Python and R programming languages throughout the processes of model training and inference. To quantify the energy consumption of Python scripts, we utilized pyJoules, and for R, we employed RJoules.
